A fast, open-source PDF editor for Windows — built with C++, Qt 6 and MuPDF. **Current version: 1.5.6**

## Download

**[⬇ Download Installer (Windows 10/11, 64-bit)](../../releases/latest)**

Run `PDFEditor-Setup.exe` and follow the wizard. No Qt, no Visual Studio, no dependencies — everything is bundled.

> **⚠️ Antivirus warning (false positive)**
> Windows Defender or your browser may flag the installer as suspicious. This is a **false positive** — the file contains no malware.
> It happens because the installer is newly published and has not yet built up a download reputation with Microsoft.
> The application is fully open source — you can review every line of code in this repository.
> To install anyway: click **More info → Run anyway** in the SmartScreen dialog, or go to **Windows Security → Protection history**, find the entry and choose **Allow**.

> **🔒 Your data is always safe.** Signatures, settings, and recent files are stored in `%APPDATA%\PDFEditor\` and are never modified by the installer or uninstaller. Updating to a new version preserves everything automatically.

## Features

### Annotation tools
- **Highlight** — drag over text to highlight it; drag over any area for a flat coloured rectangle
- **Pen** — freehand drawing with colour picker and adjustable stroke width
- **Eraser** — removes any annotation or ink stroke with a single drag
- **Text** — click anywhere on the page to insert a text annotation; double-click an existing annotation to edit it
- **Signatures** — create, save and reuse multiple signatures; drawn with the mouse or imported from a PNG/JPG
- **Insert image** — insert a PNG/JPG/BMP file as a full-page image or place it on the current page
- **Edit Text** — select any region of a scanned or native PDF to extract and edit its text: the original content is covered with a white rectangle, the recognised text is pre-filled in the editor so you can correct it and place it back on the page. Works on both native PDF text layers (instant) and true scanned images (via Tesseract OCR).

### Moving and resizing annotations
Click any annotation or inserted image in **Select mode** to show 8 resize handles:
- **Drag a handle** — resize the annotation
- **Drag the body** — move the annotation anywhere on the page
- **Double-click** — edit the text content (FreeText annotations)
- **Click elsewhere** — deselect

### Page management
- **Rotate, delete, duplicate** pages — annotations and ink are preserved on duplication
- **Merge PDFs** — drag a PDF onto an open document to append its pages, or use the Merge dialog (also supports drag & drop)
- **Split / extract pages** — save a subset of pages to a new file
- **Insert blank page** — right-click in the thumbnail panel
- **Reorder pages** — drag thumbnails in the sidebar to reorder pages

### Search
- **Ctrl+F** — search for text across all pages; matches are highlighted in yellow, the current match in orange
- Navigate results with **Enter** / **Shift+Enter** or the ▲ ▼ buttons

### Viewing
- **Real-time zoom slider** — instant live preview while dragging; snaps to 100%; **double-click to reset to 100%**
- **Zoom shortcuts** — `Ctrl+0` fit to window, `Ctrl+1` reset to 100%, `Ctrl++` / `Ctrl+-` zoom in/out
- **Page navigation** — jump field with ◀ ▶ arrows in the toolbar; updates live while scrolling
- **Auto-center on zoom** — view stays locked on the same content while zooming in and out
- **Text-aware scroll** — on open, automatically scrolls to the first line of text (not blank margins)
- **Page thumbnails** — live sidebar that updates after every edit

### Other
- **Print** — `Ctrl+P` prints via the Windows print dialog at full printer resolution
- **Form filling** — detects and fills PDF form fields
- **Watermark** — add semi-transparent text watermarks
- **Undo / Redo** — full history for all edits
- **Dark and light theme**
- **Drag & drop** — open PDFs or images by dropping them onto the window; if no PDF is open, a new document is created automatically
- **Register as Windows default PDF viewer**
- **Customisable keyboard shortcuts** (Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `S` | Select tool |
| `H` | Highlight tool |
| `P` | Pen tool |
| `E` | Eraser tool |
| `T` | Text tool |
| `U` | Signature tool |
| `X` | Edit Text tool (OCR) |
| `Esc` | Back to Select |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Undo |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Redo |
| `Ctrl+O` | Open file |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save |
| `Ctrl+P` | Print |
| `Ctrl+F` | Search |
| `Ctrl+scroll` | Zoom |
| `Ctrl+0` | Fit to window |
| `Ctrl+1` | Zoom 100% |
| `Ctrl+[` / `Ctrl+]` | Rotate page |

All shortcuts can be changed in **Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts**.

## Uninstall

Go to **Windows Settings → Apps → PDF Editor → Uninstall**, or open the **Start menu → PDF Editor → Uninstall PDF Editor**.

The uninstaller removes the program files (`Program Files\PDF Editor`) but **leaves your personal data untouched**:

| Kept | Removed |
|------|---------|
| Signatures | PDFEditor.exe and all DLLs |
| Settings (theme, shortcuts, …) | Qt plugins and translations |
| Recent file list | Desktop / Start menu shortcuts |

Your data lives in `%APPDATA%\PDFEditor\` and is never touched by the uninstaller.

**Updating** works the same way — the new installer silently removes the old version first, then installs fresh. Your settings and signatures are preserved automatically.
